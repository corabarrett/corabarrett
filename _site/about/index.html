    <h2 id="about-me">About me</h2>

<p>I believe the role of planning should be to drive regeneration and growth in a manner that is sustainable, inclusive and respects the needs and amenity of existing communities and businesses. Every scheme, no matter the size, has an obligation to create great places to live, work and visit.</p>

<p>With ten years experience as a town planner I have gained a broad range of experience working as a consultant for both private and public sector clients and most recently moving client side working in-house with a developer. As well as leading on the preparation on planning applications and planning strategies for development projects I have also worked on the preparation of planning policies and guidance. This variety of experience has given me a good insight into all aspects of town planning and the potential for the sector to facilitate the development of thriving places.</p>

<p>Planning is high up on the political agenda and these days is often cast as the villain for holding up development. While there are many local authorities struggling to get up to Local Plans adopted in order to guide development to meet local needs, issues associated with driving down housing targets or refusing planning applications for appropriate developments are often driven by local political motivations. Another big complaint about the planning system is the time taken to make decisions or for policy to be adopted. One of the main contributing factors to this is the lack of resources or skills within planning departments as local authorities are forced to make more and more cuts on an annual basis.</p>

<p>The role of planning is to facilitate the delivery of high quality development in appropriate locations. It does not deliver, but identifies the most appropriate places for development and establishes how much development would be appropriate in light of local circumstances. National policy should seek to promote the benefits of good planning and work to achieve this through appropriate funding decisions.</p>
