## The potential of planning

I have been inspired to write this post following a recent review of the Housing White Paper. While it is positive to see the Government is attempting to tackle the spiralling problems in the housing market, reading through the document I found myself questioning whether or not any of the policies would actually lead to the step change in housing delivery required. Many of the proposals amount to little more than tinkering with a broken system when in reality we should be taking this opportunity to consider how we can make a system that is fit for purpose for now and the future. Over this series of blogs I will consider responses to the consultation queries raised in the White Paper document and will set out the questions I believe we should be asking.
